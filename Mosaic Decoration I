/*PROBLEM STATEMENT
Zapray lives in a big mansion that has NN bathrooms. He wants to decorate the bathroom walls using mosaic tiles of two colors: black and pink. The iith bathroom needs B_iB
​i
​​  black tiles and P_iP
​i
​​  pink tiles. Mosaic tiles are sold in piles. Zapray can buy one pile of 1010 black tiles for C_BC
​B
​​  dollars, and one pile of 1010 pink tiles for C_PC
​P
​​  dollars. How much money does he need in total to decorate all the NN bathrooms?


Standard input
The input contains three integers N, C_B, C_PN,C
​B
​​ ,C
​P
​​  on the first line.

The next NN lines each have two integers. The iith line has B_iB
​i
​​  and P_iP
​i
​​ .


Standard output
Output a single integer, the amount of money in dollars that Zapray needs to decorate all his bathrooms.
